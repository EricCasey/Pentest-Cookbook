# FAMOUS EXPLOITS AND HACKS

## KERNEL EXPOITS

### The DirtyCow Exploit [19xx]
A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernelâ€™s memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system. It was one of the most serious privilege escalation vulnerability ever discovered and it affected almost all the major Linux distros.
